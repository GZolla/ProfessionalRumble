# My Personal Project

## Program Description
A game where rosters of employee fight each other in a pokemon-style fight but 
**without any mechanics that involve luck.**
The game is aimed at those that enjoy pokemon but seek a similar game based purely on strategy, and not randomness.
This is a collective idea I had with a friend but would love give it *actual* life through a desktop app.
