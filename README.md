# My Personal Project

## Program Description
A pokemon-style game but:
- Instead of pokemon, its professionals(e.g engineer and teacher instead of pikachu and meowth)
- Without any mechanics that involve luck.
- New mechanics added to the game

The game is aimed at those that enjoy pokemon but seek a similar game based purely on strategy, and not randomness.
This is a collective idea I had with a friend but would love give it *actual* life through a desktop app.
