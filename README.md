# My Personal Project

## Program Description
A turn-based game of strategy where two teams of professional use a combination of moves/actions to defeat the opponent,
the team with the last professional standing wins.
Moves can:
 - Cause damage to the opponent
 - Change its stats
 - Inflict statuses
 - Other combinations of these effects



Based on pokemon battles, its target audience is those that seek a similar game based purely on strategy, and not randomness.
This is a collective idea I had with a friend but would love give it *actual* life through a desktop app.
